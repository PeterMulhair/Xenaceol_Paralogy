Using clan_check to test whether gene trees from Phillipe et al study violate or not clans of known monophyly within the animal tree

Trees from 1173 gene trees (created with IQTree) present in tree_files.txt
Clans to be tested present in clans.txt are ordered as follows:
1. Lophotrochozoa
2. Porifera
3. Xenacoelomorpha
4. Chordata
5. Ecdysozoa
6. Ambulacraria
7. Cnidaria
8. Protostomia
9. Deuterostomia
10. Bilateria


Script run:
clan_check -f tree_files.txt -c clans.txt (full gene family set)
clan_check -f best_tree_files.txt -c clans.txt (gene families annotated as best by phillipe et al monophyly test)
